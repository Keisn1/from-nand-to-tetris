- only one variable type
- single regisers are used to represent variables

* Syntax
- ~@temp~
  - find some available memory register (say register n)
    and use it to represent the variable temp
  - so, from now on, each occurance of @temp in the program will be translated into @n
- makes it also "portable" to different address space
* Example
** Flip
