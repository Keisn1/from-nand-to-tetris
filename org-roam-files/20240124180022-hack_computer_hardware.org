- 16-bit computer
- nowadays 64-bits usually (x86_64)
* Components
** Instruction memory (ROM)
- also a sequence of 16-bit registers
** CPU
- performs 16-bit instructions
** Data memory (RAM)
- sequence of 16-bit registers
- [[id:7425c6d3-a86d-4828-9448-86c2459150b7][Hack computer registers]]
** Instuction bus / data bus /address buses
- enable to move data
- highways of 16 lanes, moving chunks of 16 bits
*** data bus
- connects CPU and data memory
*** instruction bus
- moves instructions from instruction memory to CPU
*** address buses
