#+startup: overview

- Registers
- ALU

- where calculations are made
- where decision of which next instructions is going to be executed

* Does 2 things
** Given an instruction, it will execute the instruction
** Can figure out, which instruction to do next
* Inputs
** [[id:7bac8f3e-14ee-45bf-808f-74796b46fcfc][Data memory]]
- inM
- data value
- value of currently selected data memory register
- value that the cpu is operating on
- at any given point, there is always a selected register in the data memory
** Instruction ([[id:cadb2fc2-260c-4516-afea-0c79d241da1f][Program memory]])
- instruction
- value of currently selected instruction memory register
- at any given point, there is always a selected register in the instruction memory
** Reset
- from user
* Outputs
** outM
- what we want to write
** addressM
- where we want to write it
** writeM (1 or 0)
- where to write it
- enabling write operations
** pc
- address of next instruction to be fetched and executed
