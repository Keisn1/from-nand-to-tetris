- Using a Screen Memory Map
- designated memory area, dedicated to manage a display unit
- physical display is continuously /refreshed/ from the memory map
- output is effected by writing code that manipurates the screen

* Display unit
- 256 by 512 = 131072
- sequence of 16-bit values (also called words)
- 8192 * 16bit = 131072
- every pixel gets a bit

* Mapping
- only 16 bits retreivable
  - 32 * 16 = 512 = 1 row
  - setting pixel on/off
    1. i=32*row + col/16 (integer division, only divisor without remainder)
       word = Screen[32*row + col/16 + 16384]
       - screen will be a chip
         - chip will be part of the data memory
         - base address changes in context of memory
         - need to add base-memory
    2. Set the (col%16)th bit of word to 0 or 1
    3. Commit word to the RAM
