#+startup: overview

* RAM
- to memorize
  - Data
  - Instructions
* RAM abstraction/RAM unit
- Random-Access-Unit
  - same access time for whatever register
  - not important which one is adressed, it takes the same time

- A sequence of /n/ addressable registers, with addresses 0 t o n-1
- _at any given point of time_, only /one/ register in the RAM is selected
- addresses are encoded via log_2_n bits
- RAM is sequential (clocked behavior)
* Read
1. set /adress = i/
2. out emits the state of /Register/
* Write
1. set /address = i/
2. set /in = v/
3. set /load=1/
