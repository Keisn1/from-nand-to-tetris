- R0 ... R15 (virtual registers)
  - values 0 to 15
  - to denote virtual registers
  - also solution to disconcerting fact that @value is used in a double-sense; also don't know what programmer wants to do without knowing the next line
  - when you use R0 to R15, you're saying that you're going to do something with the register at 0 to 15
- SCREEN ... base address (16384)
- KBD ... base address (24576)
- SP = 0
- LCL = 1
- ARG = 2
- THIS = 3
- THAT = 4
  - used in the implementation of the Hack /virtual machin/ (discussed in [[id:e0f2fef8-8acd-4b73-8903-980dfd8a3d36][NandToTetris]]2)
