#+title: two 2 complement
#+date: [2023-09-29 Fr 06:16]

way to represent negative numbers
Depending on max_value=2**n
-x = max_value - x
In machine it is easier to compute it As
-x = max_value - x = 1 + (2**n - 1) - x
2**n - 1 = (11..11)_n
2**n - 1 - x = Not(x)
than only add 1

Extremely dangerous because of overflow
The result of an addition is only correct up to modulo 2**n
Therefore [[id:dccecf1b-dbb6-4ead-82b8-88176101b030][substraction_in_two_2_complement]] is working by letting go of overflow bit, but also source of danger
