#+title: NandToTetris Counters (program counter)

#+startup: overview

* Counter is rather meant as Program Counter (PC)
* Why are they important?
- Computer needs to know what to do next
  - PC (Program Counter) contains the address of the instructions that will be done next
  - fetch and execute
* Control Settings
** Reset: Fetch first instruction (PC=0) - resetting
** Next/NoJump: Fetch next instruction (PC++) - incrementing
** unconditional Goto: fetch instruction n (PC=A) - setting
** conditional Goto: fetch instruction (PC=A) if condition is true
- need to look at ALU output
* Abstraction

/**
 * 16-bit counter with load and reset controls.
 *
 * If reset(t-1) then out(t) = 0
 *    else if load(t-1) then out(t) = in(t-1)
 *         else if inc(t-1) then out(t) = out(t-1) + 1 (integer addition)
 *              else out(t) = out(t-1)
