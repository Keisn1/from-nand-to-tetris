* Remembering State
- remember one bit of information
- Gates that can flip between two states

* Implementation
** Connecting 2 Nand Gates in a loop (not the only way)
1. Init with Ones on both Nand Gates
   - will result in nothing, since second input is not set
2. As soon as One input is set to Zero, the other Gate will have
   the second input necessary
   - Results in a stable circuitry for every future change
   - Lets you infer where the last change has taken place (upper or bottom Nand)
3. you then need to abstract this, built stuff around and make it usable with the clock
