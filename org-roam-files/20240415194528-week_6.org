Assembly Languages
* Loop until Eof
1. Read next Assembly language command
2. Break it into the different fields it is composed of
3. Lookup the binary code for each field
4. combine theses codes into a single machine language command
5. output this machine language command

* Symbols
- JMP, loop, Load ...
** forward references
- forward References to Symbols that haven't appeared yet
  #+begin_src asm
    JGT cont
    ...
    Label cont:
  #+end_src
- 2 passes, first pass figure out all addresses
* [[id:a5a45623-8bea-4e48-bd70-9bc89e7fe3f8][Hack assembly]]
* The plan
1. develop a basic assembler that translates symbol-less Hack programs
2. Develop an ability to handle symbols
3. morph the basic assembler into an assembler that translates any Hack program
