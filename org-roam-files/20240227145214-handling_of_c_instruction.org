#+startup: overview

* Handling of C-instruction
1. C-instruction arrives (1110011111010111)
2. Decoding into 4 fields
   - 1 .. ~op-code~ tells what kind of instruction
   - 11 .. ALU control bits
   - Destination load bits
   - Jump bits
3. Will use ALU-output (former outputs) to execute instructions

- keep in mind:
  - C-instruction consists of different fields,
  - ALU always computes something
- controlbit of multiplexer is one of the bits in the instruction
