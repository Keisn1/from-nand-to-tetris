* Register NandToTetris
- take 1-bit remembering unit (Register) to a multi-bit register (the actual *Register*)
- w (word width): 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit
- Register's state: the value which is currently stored inside the register
- builtin-chips in nandToTetris/tools/ has a Register Chip
  - in HardwareSimulator -> RegisterChip is clocked
  - Clock-icon will pop-up -> will simulate the train of cycles
    - in 2 cycles per time unit
  - GUI has a sideeffect that shows the current state
